Post-lesson note to self: This timetable did not go as planned. What was planned as 
lesson 1 and 2 was actually more or less finished in the first lesson. On the other 
hand, the MCE-Exercise took about an hour, rather than 25 minutes, and was an ideal
"getting your hands dirty", exercise in QGIS.
