## Git Setup


- Upstreams:
  - `origin` is the default upstream, the ADLS slides REPO
  - `upstream` is the original repo with the UI-Slides
- Releases
  - For FS24, I added the slides *as presented* as a release and added the printed PDF as a binary file to the release. Maybe this is a good approach for other repos as well?
