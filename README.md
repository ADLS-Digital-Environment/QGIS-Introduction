## ToDo in 2024:

- [ ] the MCE is too complex, make it smaller. It currently tries to resemble what they did in the GIS course, but that is not necessary. Make it smaller and more focused on the workshop.


## General

- Use the plugin countdownjs to create a countdown timer: https://github.com/christer79/reveal_countdown
- Workshop notes: These are integrated into the speaker notes!
